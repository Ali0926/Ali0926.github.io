🎉 Ali's Personal Website – Powered by GitHub Pages

Welcome to the repo behind my personal website — a place where I break things, fix them, learn fast, and pretend I didn’t break them in the first place.
Built with a keyboard, caffeine, way too many commits, and GitHub Pages.

🧰 What’s Inside?

This website is built with:

HTML5 (because sometimes simple is powerful)

Git (my new best friend and occasional enemy)

GitHub Pages (doing the heavy lifting while I sleep)

GitHub Actions (so I can finally say “I know CI/CD”)

CI/CD testing (to prevent future-me from shipping disasters)

🎯 Why This Exists

I built this site to:

Share my journey from IT Operations → Platform Engineering

Practice real version control with Git

Learn how to deploy static websites

Explore GitHub Actions, automated workflows, and CI/CD pipelines

Experiment, break things, fix things, repeat

Build something cool that I actually own


🔧 Future Experiments

Add more projects (even the ugly ones — learning counts!)

Build a mini blog

Add JavaScript interactivity

Hook CI/CD tests into my site builds

Keep improving as I train in platform engineering
